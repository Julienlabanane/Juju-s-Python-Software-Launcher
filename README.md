The default ttk theme: [here](https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme)

My roadmap:

- You will be able to download my future software in this application (like Steam)
- Account system
- More configurable launcher
- Use of tabs to create a future interface
- block old unsupported operating systems (Windows 8.1 and older, Mac OS X Monterey* for security reasons)
- remove messagebox in future versions, replaced by "classic" window
- a functional market
- a functional system package(like .msi for Windows, .dmg for Mac OS, .deb or .rpm for Linux, .pkg for BSD...)
- a functional auto-updater
- a functional payment system (with PayPal and Stripe for exemple, i can't implement this today)
for this plethora of features, I need your help, if you want to help me, contact me on GitHub or by email : juju@gamerjuju68.ovh

*Use Open Legacy Patcher to install Mac OS X Ventura on unsupported Macs or use a Linux distribution ðŸ˜‰ also i think this program work on Aarch64 Macs but i can't test it(i don't have money to buy a Mac M1/M2ðŸ˜‰)
